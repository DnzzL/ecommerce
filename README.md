## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I focused on the mobile-first workflow so much that I didn't anticipated enough the desktop version.

I liked the ease of use of Tailwind but I disliked how messy it can become with media queries or when the desktop layout is very different from the mobile one.
